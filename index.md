## Idea

I often get asked, "Hey how do you drive with this thing?(my skateboard)". This is a strange question for me to hear as it is my daily driver and it's a skateboard like any other. My skateboard([Elos](https://elosskateboards.com/)) is a conversation starter and I would like to extend it, so I can also directly show a creative project related to it.

This gave me the idea, to create animations, that show various ways on how my skateboard can be skated. These animations will be crafted in a 3D software and could show various environments.

As another option, I could also craft other funny skateboard forms in 3D.

I could also create an interactive skateboard configurator in the web with threeJS.

Apart from the main topic, I can also use this as an exercise to create a scene and handcraft assets for this scene.

### Texture creation

Goal: Learn how to create and apply textures to models.

- Try adobe 3D model creation with photos(adobe substance 3d sampler)
  - How to use these models as a base and how to refine?

1. Skateboard Textures

   - Hair Texture: Design a suitable hair texture.
   - Accessory Textures: Design textures for any accessories the character might wear (hat, sunglasses, etc.).
3. Environmental Textures
   - Street/Sidewalk Texture: Develop textures for the ground where the skating is taking place, considering elements like asphalt, concrete, or cobblestones.
   - Ramp/Park Textures: If a skate park or ramps are involved, create textures for these surfaces.
   - Building/Wall Textures: Create textures for any surrounding buildings, walls, or other large surfaces.
   - Nature Textures: Design textures for any natural elements, such as grass, trees, or sky.
4. Obstacle Textures
   - Rail and Ledge Textures: Generate metallic or stone textures for rails and ledges in the skate environment.
Staircase Textures: If there are staircases, create textures for steps and handrails.
5. Additional Props Textures
   - Trash Can, Benches, etc.: Design textures for any additional props in the animation scene.
6. Weather and Time Effects
   - Wet Surface Textures: If depicting rainy or wet conditions, create wet, reflective surface textures.
   - Night-Time Textures: For night scenes, create textures with appropriate lighting and reflections.
7. Texture Optimization
   - Optimizing for Performance: Ensure textures are optimized for performance, maintaining a balance between quality and rendering load.
8. Final Review and Adjustment
   - Conduct a detailed review of all textures in the animation to ensure consistency and realism.

#### Texture sources

Find textures for models.
Materials: Set up the materials for models.
Think about possible scenes for presentation: Plan and design the scenes for animation.

## Finishing:

### How to render

Goal: Understand the rendering process in Blender.

- Try different shaders


### Weather

Decide the weather condition for scene.

### Sound effect

Goal: Incorporate audio into animation. Add specific sound effects that correspond with the actions in the animation.

1. Skateboard Sounds
   - Wheels Rolling: Create or find sound effects for the skateboard wheels rolling on different surfaces.
   - Tricks: Sounds for ollies, kickflips, grinds, and other skateboard tricks.
   - Collisions: Sounds for the skateboard hitting obstacles or crashing.
   - Board Components: Specific sounds for different parts of the skateboard (e.g., trucks moving).
2. Character Sounds
   - Footsteps: Different sound effects for character movements.
   - Clothing: Sounds of clothing rustling as the character moves.
   - Vocalizations: Grunts, exclamations, or other sounds made by the character.
3. Ambient Sounds
   - Outdoor Ambience: Background noise for outdoor scenes (birds chirping, wind blowing, etc.).
   - Urban Ambience: Sounds typical of a city or town setting (traffic, people talking, etc.).
   - Indoor Ambience: Echoes, room noise, or other relevant ambient sounds for indoor settings.
4. Environmental Sounds
   - Obstacle Interaction: Sounds related to interacting with various obstacles (e.g., ramps, rails).
   - Weather Effects: If the scene involves different weather conditions, include appropriate sound effects (rain, thunder, etc.).
5. Music
   - Background Music: Choose or create a suitable musical track to accompany the animation.
   - Musical Cues: Short musical pieces for transitions, successful tricks, or other significant moments.
6. Additional Sound Effects

   - Balancing: Adjust the volume levels of different sound elements for clarity and emphasis.
   - Sound Quality Enhancement: Utilize sound editing tools to enhance the quality and impact of sound effects.
8. Final Review and Adjustment
   - Conduct a thorough review of the sound design and make necessary adjustments for optimal audio experience.

## Exporting

### VR

Goal: Ensure the scene is optimized for VR viewing if necessary.

- Consider entertaining or educational VR applications for the animation.

## Potential Time-Consuming and Challenging Areas:

- Character Design and Sculpting: Designing and sculpting a character can be a time-consuming process because it involves both creative and technical skills.
- Rigging: Rigging is a technical process to set up a character for animation, and it can be complex, especially if you're dealing with detailed characters and movements.
- Physics and Animation: Getting the physics right for skateboarding movements and tricks could be quite tricky and time-consuming, especially if aiming for realism.
- Texture Creation: Creating and applying textures that look realistic is also a task that requires attention to detail and can be time-consuming.
- Rendering: Rendering the final project, especially with high-quality settings, can be very time-consuming.
- Sound Design: Sound design and synchronization with the animation could also pose a challenge.
- Implementing in VR: If not familiar with VR, figuring out the specifications for creating a VR-compatible scene could also take time.

## Braindump

- How to integrate the skateboard onto a website and make it available for android ar and ios ar
- Create a site with helpful links and shortcuts tailored to me
- Research shaders for different artstyles
  - E.g. [viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/) also uses different artstyles
- Create a product design for an elos skateboard that has some integrated legs and allows the skateboard to be converted to a table/seat
- Configurator
  - import an image that has transparency and then creates a skateboard from the extracted form
