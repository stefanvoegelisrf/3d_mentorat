# 3D Mentorat

## Idea

I often get asked, "Hey how do you drive with this thing?(my skateboard)". This is a strange question for me to hear as it is my daily driver and it's a skateboard like any other.

This gave me the idea, to create animations, that show various ways on how my skateboard can be skated. These animations will be crafted in a 3D software.

As another option, I could also craft other funny skateboard forms. I could also create an interactive skateboard configurator.

## Goals

- Create a 3D mini me
- Learn materials
- Learn Keyboard Shortcuts
- Create textures
- Use assets
- Rig a 3D model
- 3D animation
