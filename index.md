# 3D Mentorat

## Idea

I often get asked, "Hey how do you drive with this thing?(my skateboard)". This is a strange question for me to hear as it is my daily driver and it's a skateboard like any other. My skateboard([Elos](https://elosskateboards.com/)) is a conversation starter and I would like to extend it, so I can also directly show a creative project related to it.

This gave me the idea, to create animations, that show various ways on how my skateboard can be skated. These animations will be crafted in a 3D software and could show various environments.

As another option, I could also craft other funny skateboard forms in 3D.

I could also create an interactive skateboard configurator in the web with threeJS.

Apart from the main topic, I can also use this as an exercise to create a scene and handcraft assets for this scene.

## Goals

- Create a 3D mini me
- Learn materials
- Learn Keyboard Shortcuts
- Create textures
- Use assets
- Rig a 3D model
- 3D animation
- Interactive website using threeJS
- Finish course [threeJS journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)

  - Advanced sculpting or asset creation videos
  - Texture creation videos
  - Texture sources
  - Materials
  - Inform about how stuff could be rendered
  - Physics
    - Experiment with physics animations
      - Drop a skateboard from some height onto surfaces and see how it behaves?
        - Is there something interesting to it that I can further use?

- How does motion capture work?
  - Can I implement it in my project?
  - Do we have stuff that I could lend at leihs?

- Could this scene be easily viewed in a vr headset?
  - What could be funny use cases for vr?

- How to integrate the skateboard onto a website and make it available for android ar and ios ar

- Create a site with helpful links and shortcuts tailored to me
- Create a moodboard
  - What should the vibe be?
  - Weather?
  - Sound?
  - Sound effects?
  - Use screenshots from already done animations
- Think about possible scenes for presentation
- Watch skateboarding videos
  - find typical cameras and camera settings used(e.g. fisheye)
  - Find typical camera angles

  - How do I want to do documentation? What is suitable?

- How can I create a minifigure of me skating the skateboard?
- Try adobe 3D model creation with photos(adobe substance 3d sampler)
  - How to use these models as a base and how to refine?

- Create a factory animation that creates random skateboards

- Create an animation where I drive through the streets and heads of all people turn around
  - Formula 1 style
    - me driving through somewhere and heavily blurred and you only see me for like 2 seconds

- Create an animation road runner style

- Try different shaders
- Research shaders for different artstyles
  - E.g. [viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/) also uses different artstyles

- Create a product design for an elos skateboard that has some integrated legs and allows the skateboard to be converted to a table/seat

- How to add raining effect?
- Configurator
  - import an image that has transparency and then creates a skateboard from the extracted form

- Poses for skating
  - handstand
  - sitting
  - holding it and driving on the wall
    - start with camera angle that looks like the skateboard is on the ground and then rotate so it is the real angle

- Analog prototypes?
