## Idea

I often get asked, "Hey how do you drive with this thing?(my skateboard)". This is a strange question for me to hear as it is my daily driver and it's a skateboard like any other. My skateboard([Elos](https://elosskateboards.com/)) is a conversation starter and I would like to extend it, so I can also directly show a creative project related to it.

This gave me the idea, to create animations, that show various ways on how my skateboard can be skated. These animations will be crafted in a 3D software and could show various environments.

As another option, I could also craft other funny skateboard forms in 3D.

I could also create an interactive skateboard configurator in the web with threeJS.

Apart from the main topic, I can also use this as an exercise to create a scene and handcraft assets for this scene.

## Goals

- Create a 3D mini me
- Learn materials
- Learn Keyboard Shortcuts
- Create textures
- Use assets
- Rig a 3D model
- 3D animation
- Interactive website using threeJS
- Finish course [threeJS journey](https://threejs-journey.com/)

### MVP

One skateboard animation with a beautiful scene displaying one way to use my skateboard.

Minimum duration must be 7-10 seconds.

Assets and textures are created by me or captured in the real world. Animation is done by hand or either motion capture. If animation by hand is taking too long, shortcuts will be used. This is done to not use up too much time for animation and insted use the time for experimenting.

One skateboard model, explorable in the web as a 3D model, including AR.

### Nice to haves

- multiple animations
- Skateboard configurator in the web with threeJS
- Funny plot
- Speech, Music, Effects - createc by myself

## Potential Time-Consuming and Challenging Areas:

- Character Design and Sculpting: Designing and sculpting a character can be a time-consuming process because it involves both creative and technical skills.
- Rigging: Rigging is a technical process to set up a character for animation, and it can be complex, especially if you're dealing with detailed characters and movements.
- Physics and Animation: Getting the physics right for skateboarding movements and tricks could be quite tricky and time-consuming, especially if aiming for realism.
- Texture Creation: Creating and applying textures that look realistic is also a task that requires attention to detail and can be time-consuming.
- Rendering: Rendering the final project, especially with high-quality settings, can be very time-consuming.
- Sound Design: Sound design and synchronization with the animation could also pose a challenge.
- Implementing in VR: If not familiar with VR, figuring out the specifications for creating a VR-compatible scene could also take time.

## Braindump

- How to integrate the skateboard onto a website and make it available for android ar and ios ar
- Create a site with helpful links and shortcuts tailored to me
- Research shaders for different artstyles
  - E.g. [viewfinder](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1382070/Viewfinder/) also uses different artstyles
- Create a product design for an elos skateboard that has some integrated legs and allows the skateboard to be converted to a table/seat
- Configurator
  - import an image that has transparency and then creates a skateboard from the extracted form
