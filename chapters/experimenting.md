## Character design

Goal: Start the design and conceptualization of characters.

- Search tutorials
- How can I create a minifigure of me skating the skateboard?

## Advanced sculpting or asset creation videos

Goal: Learn techniques for creating assets and details for models.

## Physics

Goal: Begin to explore the physics options in Blender.

- Drop a skateboard from some height onto surfaces and see how it behaves?

### Experiment with physics animations

Test different physics settings to see how the skateboard behaves in different situations.

### How does motion capture work?

Goal: Understand the process of motion capture.

- Determine the feasibility of using motion capture in my project.
  - There is a motion capture suit available at leihs: [DK MD xsens Motion Capture Suit](https://ausleihe.hslu.ch/borrow/models/c70d6d65-86c8-4e4a-92ee-28624e931e5b)
- Check the availability of necessary equipment or tools at leihs or other sources.
