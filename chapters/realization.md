## Scene

- Think about possible scenes for presentation
- Create an animation where I drive through the streets and heads of all people turn around
  - Formula 1 style
    - me driving through somewhere and heavily blurred and you only see me for like 2 seconds
- Create an animation road runner style
- Create a factory animation that creates random skateboards


## Rigging

Goal: Create a skeleton for 3D model to make it animatable.

- Search tutorials

### Poses for skating

Develop basic poses for characters and skateboard.

- handstand
- sitting
- holding it and driving on the wall
  - start with camera angle that looks like the skateboard is on the ground and then rotate so it is the real angle

## Texture creation

Goal: Learn how to create and apply textures to models.

- Try adobe 3D model creation with photos(adobe substance 3d sampler)
  - How to use these models as a base and how to refine?

1. Skateboard Textures
   - Grip Tape Texture: Create a rough, gritty texture for the skateboard’s grip tape.
   - Deck Art Texture: Design or choose art for the underside of the skateboard.
   - Wheel and Truck Textures: Develop realistic metal and rubber textures for the wheels and trucks.
2. Character Textures
   - Clothing Textures: Create textures for the character’s clothing, considering different materials and designs.
   - Skin Texture: Generate a realistic skin texture for the character.
   - Hair Texture: Design a suitable hair texture.
   - Accessory Textures: Design textures for any accessories the character might wear (hat, sunglasses, etc.).
3. Environmental Textures
   - Street/Sidewalk Texture: Develop textures for the ground where the skating is taking place, considering elements like asphalt, concrete, or cobblestones.
   - Ramp/Park Textures: If a skate park or ramps are involved, create textures for these surfaces.
   - Building/Wall Textures: Create textures for any surrounding buildings, walls, or other large surfaces.
   - Nature Textures: Design textures for any natural elements, such as grass, trees, or sky.
4. Obstacle Textures
   - Rail and Ledge Textures: Generate metallic or stone textures for rails and ledges in the skate environment.
Staircase Textures: If there are staircases, create textures for steps and handrails.
1. Additional Props Textures
   - Trash Can, Benches, etc.: Design textures for any additional props in the animation scene.
2. Weather and Time Effects
   - Wet Surface Textures: If depicting rainy or wet conditions, create wet, reflective surface textures.
   - Night-Time Textures: For night scenes, create textures with appropriate lighting and reflections.
3. Texture Optimization
   - Optimizing for Performance: Ensure textures are optimized for performance, maintaining a balance between quality and rendering load.
4. Final Review and Adjustment
   - Conduct a detailed review of all textures in the animation to ensure consistency and realism.

### Texture sources

Find textures for models.
Materials: Set up the materials for models.
Think about possible scenes for presentation: Plan and design the scenes for animation.
